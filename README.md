# Codecrafters git

Solution to the [Codecrafters git](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/git/completed) challenge.

- Everything works.
- Contains comment on code.
- Have minimal usage on `unwrap` / `expect`.
- Use minimal possible extra crate 😁.

## What can be improved in this code

- For some reason huge repository like CPython does not work ... There may be a bug 🐞.
- Add more unit tests.
- Using `Bytes` crate more often can make the code simpler.
- Using temporary packet file could avoid having to load the whole `.pack` file in memory.
- Server response `packet-line` can be parsed better.
